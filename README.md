# Welcome to the `javaPlex` Persistent Homology Library 

## Topological Data Analysis and Persistent Homology 

The `javaPlex` library implements persistent homology and related techniques from computational and applied topology, in a library designed for ease of use, ease of access from Matlab and java-based systems, and ease of extensions for further research projects and approaches.

`javaPlex` is mainly developed by the [Computational Topology workgroup](http://comptop.stanford.edu) at Stanford University, and is based on previous similar packages from the same group.

For persistent homology and its capabilities, we recommend the survey article [Topology and Data](http://comptop.stanford.edu/preprints/topologyAndData.pdf) by Gunnar Carlsson.

## How to get started?
  
* Start playing around with the latest [matlab examples](http://javaplex.googlecode.com/files/matlab-examples-4.1.0.tar.gz)
* Read the [tutorial](https://github.com/javaplex/javaplex/wiki/Tutorial)
* Take a look at the [documentation overview](https://github.com/javaplex/javaplex/wiki/Overview)
* Download the latest [jar file](http://javaplex.googlecode.com/files/javaplex-4.1.0.jar) and start playing with the Java code

## For more information

* Read the [documentation](https://github.com/javaplex/javaplex/wiki/Overview)
