As of spring 2014, we have moved to this present page at GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Updates\r\n\r\n* July, 2014: Version 4.2.1 released and is available [here](https://github.com/javaplex/javaplex/releases/tag/4.2.1)\r\n* April, 2014: Google Code hosting abandoned\r\n* May, 2012: Version 4.1.0 released\r\n* For frequently asked questions regarding `javaPlex` and troubleshooting information, consult the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/javaplex/javaplex/wiki/Troubleshooting) page.\r\n","google":"UA-45825257-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
