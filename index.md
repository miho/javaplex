== Topological Data Analysis and Persistent Homology ==

The `javaPlex` library implements persistent homology and related techniques from computational and applied topology, in a library designed for ease of use, ease of access from Matlab and java-based systems, and ease of extensions for further research projects and approaches.

`javaPlex` is mainly developed by the [http://comptop.stanford.edu Computational Topology workgroup] at Stanford University, and is based on previous similar packages from the same group.

For persistent homology and its capabilities, we recommend the survey article [http://comptop.stanford.edu/preprints/topologyAndData.pdf Topology and Data] by Gunnar Carlsson.
